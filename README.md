# Team-Project

### About this project
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive word games utilizing html and flask. By answering just 11 questions, the website will tell you how long you can survive when zombie 🧟‍♂️ attacks the town you lived.

👉 Here is my proposal: https://github.com/Helenbzbz/Team-Project/blob/main/proposal%20pivoted.md

### Skills utilized
1. 🏃‍♀️ Flask app (redirect, render_template)
2. 🧍‍♀️ HTML (margin, font-size, text-align, color)
3. 🤸‍♀️ Class (I defined two class for two types of questions: single and multiple)

### How to launch this game
1. 🧜‍♀️ Clone the whole folder 'Team-Project'
2. 🧚‍♀️ Open and Launch this file: https://github.com/Helenbzbz/Team-Project/blob/main/app.py
3. 🙋‍♀️ Open the local host in your broswer and you can start to play this game!

### Function fulfilled/Not Fullfilled
1. 🙆‍♀️ Fullfilled: Radio selection (question with single choice)
2. 🙆‍♀️ Fullfilled: Checkbox selection (question with more than 1 choices) => Restrict the upper limit of choices, once exceeds, the page will be redirected
3. 🙆‍♀️ Fullfilled: UI/UX design (through adding margin, changing font size, and center some buttoms, make this website more user-friendly)
4. 🙅‍♀️ Not Fulfiiled: Image Display (I tried to add image, and also tried set up static route, but everytime it returns 400 error)

### Reflection and Future improvement
1. As I mentioned, I orignally want to insert image for one of the questions and even control the time for image to appear. However, I didn't achieve this purpose. Therefore, I should definitely in the future improve on that.
2. This website has one error that I tried to fix but failed. When user didn't choose any option and press 'Next Question' button, there is a bad request error. After trying to redirect bad request to the original route, Internal Server error appears. This is a huge improvement I can make for this project.
3. Besides, I feel this project may be too repetitative that there are certain function I believe can be simplified by adding one variable instead of writing 13 html templates. That's also the same way I felt for writing app route.
