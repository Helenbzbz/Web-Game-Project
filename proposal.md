# Final Project Proposal

## The Big Idea

As you can probably tell from the name of this proposal, I pivoted my idea on final project ;( I changed my idea mostly because I realized many people on the internet and some classmates worked on similar projects already and I want to do something special and interest. Besides, I played an interesting web games several days ago and I found it could be a very good inspiration for my final project. 
The overall idea for this project is to develop an interactive website game that by answering several different questions and completing one interactive action, it returns a result. For example, the result can be how long you can survive when zombie attack your town.
I drew one of such page in the following sketch and there will be series of questions like the one I show in this one.
This is a sktech of game sample question

## Learning Goals

I regard this project as a good practice of what I learnt in this class so far. 
The biggest goal is to use Python to turn my ideas into a useful website. 
By the end of the project, I wish I will learn some contents outside the scope of the courses. 
The contents I might learn includes UI/UX, how to add interactive visual elements in a website, and how to visualize information in Python in a more user-friendly manner. 
I hope after this project, I can be more experienced and efficient at building website from scratch and managing database.
This project will also train me on how to manage a project timelines and divide the work appropriately into time blocks.

## Implementation Plan & Project Schedule

I break down the project into the following tasks and allocate these tasks into the 3.5 weeks schedule.
Since I chose to work alone, there is no collaboration plan.

**Week 1. 4.7~4.14**
1. *Write the codes for 4~5 questions with only one choice*
- A function that will ask user to choose one from the given choices and this function will atomatic return a score based on the choice.
- A flask code that will print several buttons upon request for each question and allow user to click one
- This page should then lead user to the next page but user's score will be saved somewhere (currently thinking write a file to record).
2. *Write the codes for 2~3 questions with multiple choices* 
- A function that will ask user to choose n items from the given choices and this function will atomatic return a score based on the choice.
- A flask code that will print several buttons upon request for each question and allow user to select a given number of questions.
- This page should then lead user to the next page but user's score will be saved somewhere (currently thinking write a file to record).

**Week 2. 4.14~4.21**
1. *Write an interactive question*
- When opening this question, several photos of zombie or human of will quickly flash on the screen. The player have to speculate which choice give the biggest likelihood of meeting a human and choose the answer based on their memory.
- A function that will ask user to choose one from the given choices and this function will atomatic return a score based on the choice.
- A flask that can shows each photo quickly and then disappear in order and then allow user to click the button to choose.
- This page should then lead user to the next page but user's score will be saved somewhere (currently thinking write a file to record).

**Week 3. 4.21~4.28**
1. Improve UI/UX of the website
2. Improve the projects, preapre for demo session

The following 3 things I need to learn during this weekend before I can start to work on the project:
1. How to save inputs or data in a database so that next time when it proceeds to the next page, it still has the information I entered previously
2. How to organize the website design to make it more userfriendly
3. How do I add photos or let the photo move on the flask

## Risks

I considered this project as a little bit ambitious and I am unsure whether I can successfully complete all my desired functions. 
Given we only have 3 weeks to finish this project, I will first finish the core function of the website, single choice question, and then moves on to finish other function if possible.
If the tasks turned out to be more difficult than I thought, I may give up on the visual elements part.

## Additional Course Content

I think we will cover how to save data on website in the following classes? I think more materials about user interactive functions will be very helpful.
One thing I am personally interested in is how to create a website that user have to register in order to use it. But I think it might be too advanced.
